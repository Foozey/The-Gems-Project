The Gems Project is a Minecraft mod built for Forge. The mod aims to improve Minecraft's progression system through balanced additions to all categories of game mechanics. If you have any issues using the mod, please provide a detailed post through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Foozey/The-Gems-Project/issues).

## 💎 Features
### New Ores and Equipment
Each of these powerful new ores can be found from y: 16 and below. They are rarer than diamonds but are more common the deeper you delve. They also only drop shards upon breaking, which you'll need to combine to make a whole gem. These new ores come in both stone and deepslate variants. Topaz, Sapphire, and Ruby have many uses, but most of which you won't be able to access until you have Netherite equipment.

### More Tiers
Finally, we have access to new bows, crossbows, shields, and horse armor! The Gems Project provides the tiers that were absent in vanilla, along with new tiers utilising the new materials introduced by the mod. Each tier has increased stats from the previous, such as increased damage and durability, while maintaining a balanced gameplay experience.

### Jewelry
The jewelry system takes advantage of the Curios API, allowing you to equip them in slots independent of the armor system. They provide passive buffs which coincide with the gem used to craft them.

### Truly Endgame Equipment
Craft yourself some truly exceptional equipment with Dragonyx, a new rare but powerful material. Dragonyx provides all the bonuses that Topaz, Sapphire, and Ruby provide, along with some unique effects. Weapons provide Lifesteal, healing yourself upon damaging an enemy. Tools provide an increase to your Harvest Area, increasing the amount of blocks you can mine at once. Each piece of armor increases your Max Health by a heart and additionally prevents you from dying to the void if you're wearing a full set. In order to obtain a full set of Dragonyx equipment, the Ender Dragon will need to be defeated multiple times.

### Emerald Equipment
Instead of just making an uninteresting new set of tools and armor like most mods adding emerald equipment, The Gems Project takes a different approach. The tools allow you to gather Bonus XP, making them especially useful in the early to mid-game, whilst being iron level in other stats to avoid being overpowered. The armor grants a bonus to Movement Speed per each piece equipped and additionally provides a level of Hero of the Village if you're wearing a full set.

### Experience Ore
It's exactly what it says on the tin, ore that contains experience. This feature just adds that little bit of extra spice to the mining experience and further encourages cave exploration.

### Fossils
There are 20 fossils for you to find and collect throughout your Minecraft journey. These are found within all vanilla dimensions and are a great decorative block, but also provide an alternative source of bones. More are planned for these in the future!
