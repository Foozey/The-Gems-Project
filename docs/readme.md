# The Gems Project
The Gems Project is a Minecraft mod built for the Forge mod loader and API. The mod aims to improve Minecraft's progression system through balanced additions to all categories of game mechanics.

Included in the package of this readme file is the source code for the mod. I am not currently allowing redistribution of any kind, especially commercial. However, feel free to modify the source code for personal use. Please contact me if you wish to make publicly available 'addons' for the mod. If you have some great ideas that you would love to be implemented, let me know!

If you have any issues using the mod, please provide a detailed post through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Foozey/The-Gems-Project/issues).
